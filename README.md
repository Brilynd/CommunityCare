# CommunityCare
Columbia Divhacks 2024 - Tech for Social Good

10/5-10/6

Due to the recent events of Hurricane Helene, which has impacted immediate members of our group, we wanted to create something relevant that could offer real help to those affected. We recognize that climate change is increasing the prevalence of natural disasters, and we wanted to develop an application that provides crucial assistance to those in need during these challenging times.

### What it does
CommunityCare connects communities impacted by natural disasters with vital relief resources, volunteers, and first responders, facilitating swift rescue efforts and supporting long-term rebuilding. The platform allows users to post their needs, enabling the community to mobilize and provide targeted support.

### How we built it
- **Backend:** We set up a MongoDB database to store user requests and information, built secure authentication, and created APIs to interact with the frontend.
- **Frontend:** We used React.js to create each page and component, ensuring a user-friendly experience for those posting and responding to requests.
- **Design:** We used Figma to design the user interface, prioritizing simplicity and accessibility.
- **Domain:** We used GoDaddy to secure the domain for the project.
- **APIs:** We implemented the Google Places API to capture longitude and latitude for user requests and integrated the Google Maps API to showcase pins for affected areas.

### Challenges we ran into
- **Design:** Balancing a clean, intuitive interface with the complexity of user needs during disasters was a challenge.
- **Code:** Three out of four team members were new to React.js, and connecting the frontend with the MongoDB backend required learning on the fly. We also experienced Git merge issues which kept setting our progress back. 

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of our ability to stick with our idea despite facing technical and design challenges. Additionally, this was the first time many of the group members participated in a hackathon, and they willingly and quickly learned new software and skills on the spot.

### What we learned
We learned the importance of collaboration and flexibility, especially when working with new technologies and tackling complex problems. We also gained valuable experience in full-stack development and building solutions with real-world impact.

### What's next for CommunityCare
- **Connect with local non-profits:** Collaborate with non-profits to help them find opportunities to support disaster-impacted communities.
- **Partner with utility providers:** Establish connections with gas and electric companies to ensure they can provide critical services and resources in the aftermath of disasters.
- **Assess disaster damage:** Develop tools to assess the damage from natural disasters to help determine eligibility for recovery programs and federal assistance.
- **Incorporating AI:** Implement AI that can answer commonly asked questions, provide resources, and redirect certain requests to utility providers.
